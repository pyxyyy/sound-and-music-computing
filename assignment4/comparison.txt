the two .wav files sound different as the piano notes in scale.wav continues to linger (i.e. amplitude > 0)
after the next note is played, in contrast to the generated sin_scale.wav where each note cuts off sharply (i.e.
amplitude = 0) when the next note is played. this is clearly observable if you plot spectrograms of both .wav files.
another factor that attributes to the different sound between the two .wav files is the non-equal rate of amplitude
reduction of each note with time; in scale.wav the amplitude decrease for a note as time passes occurs at a much higher
rate than in sin_scale.wav, apparent from the difference in intensity on the spectrograms. additionally, another reason
for the difference is that there are harmonic partials that are present in scale.wav that are not present in
sin_scale.wav (i.e. the higher freq partials). these three factors collectively contribute to the difference in the
sounds of scale.wav and sin_scale.wav.
